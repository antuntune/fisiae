Herr John Levine hat mehrere Probleme mit dem von uns installierten Heizungssystem gemeldet. Das Wasser im Badezimmer braucht über 5 Minuten, um warm zu werden. Die Temperatur im Haus ist zu niedrig und kann nicht erhöht werden. Die Bedienungsanleitung fehlt möglicherweise, und die Fußbodenheizung im Badezimmer funktioniert nicht richtig – die Fliesen sind morgens kalt. Herr Levine bittet darum, dass wir schnellstmöglich jemanden schicken, um diese Probleme zu lösen.

The term **business** intelligence was coined by German computer scientist Hans Peter Luhn in 1958. However it was not until the 1990s that the **term** came into widespread use. Businesses collect **data** on almost everything. A sales representative writes an **email** to a customer. Then he or she files a report in the customer relationship management system **CRM**. When a defective product is returned, **quality assurance** inputs the relevant data into the ERP so manufacturing 10 processes may be improved. Every time an employee is paid or takes a day off, **human resources** update their data. Over time, this **generates** a large amount of data which needs to be **analysed**. This is where business **intelligence** software comes in. The goal of enterprise software is to help the people who run businesses make better **decisions**. Hence the term decision **support** system (DSS). The system looks at all of the data which the business generates before creating **statistics**. These could contain **reports** on how many defective products were returned last month. If the number of returns is above a certain **tolerance**, such a report could indicate a problem in the manufacturing process. But BI also enables more **complex** reports. For instance it is possible to see how a customer's orders are **related to** how the sales representative interacts with the customer. The report could show that a customer is more **likely** to buy a new product following a demonstration rather than in response to an email telling him or her about the product.

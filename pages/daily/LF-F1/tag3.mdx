#### Task - Describe your past or future job

In a few years, I would like to have a job in IT that allows me to work from home at least 80% of the time. Ideally, I aspire to become a developer, preferably a **web developer**. After achieving that, I would like to become a **freelancer** or start my own small business or continue with the one which I already started last year.

#### Task - Text summary

Storage devices used in computers, highlighting two types of memory: **primary (volatile)** and **secondary (non-volatile)**. Secondary memory, such as hard drives, CD-ROMs and USB flash drives, is used for permanent data storage. Storage devices can be optical, magnetic, or mechanical and advances in technology have made them cheaper and more capacious, now reaching terabytes.

#### Task - The next storage revolution

Holographic data storage, however, is just the beginning of the next data storage **revolution**. Researchers are already looking into storing data in things such as **bacteria**, In 2010 a Chinese team from the University of Hong Kong successfully managed to encode **molecule chains** in a colony of E.coli. Their method is far from **market ready** and will require many more years of research to perfect, but, in theory, using just one gram of bacteria one could store up to **90 GB**.

However, to get new ideas for data storage you don't have to look into a microscope. Simply look into the **mirror**. Our brain stores memories, which are really also just bits and bytes of data, by forming new **mass** and storing them. Yes, we may sometimes forget where we put our car keys, but the amount of **information** we can store in the memory centres of our **brain** is estimated to be somewhere around 2.5 **petabytes**. So researchers are also looking into storing data using similar molecule chains.

But all of the above seems laughable when you start looking at **quantum mechanics**. Today we cannot begin to imagine the amounts of **data** we will be able to store and **process** at truly **incredible** speeds. None of us alive today may live to see the day when mankind starts using quantum computers to store data. At present, in scientific **experiments**, quantum computers and storage only function for a few **seconds**, but one day, and that day may still be a century or more away, **quantum computing** will become a reality.

#### Task - Assembling a Computer

1. **The Case**
   - Remove the screws on the back of the case. Then open the side panels of the case. Now you can remove the side panels from the case. Lay the case on its right side (as seen from the front).
2. **The Power Supply**
   - Insert the power supply in the upper part of the case. Make sure that the power supply is installed so that the fans are free and not covered by the case panel.
3. **The Mainboard**
   - Mount the mainboard in the case. Be sure to use the correct screws. The screws must not be tightened too much! Then the mainboard must be connected to the power supply. Use the operating instructions for the mainboard for this.
4. **The Processor**
   - The CPU is already mounted on the mainboard with a fan. Connect the fan to the mainboard according to the instructions for the mainboard.
5. **The RAM**
   - You will find the DIMM socket for the RAM on the mainboard. Carefully open the clamps on the RAM socket and insert the RAM module into the socket. Press the RAM bar down evenly and firmly until the clamps snap into place. Make sure that you insert the bar in the correct direction. A notch on the bar only allows one possibility.
6. **The Graphics Card**
   - Mount the graphics card on the corresponding slot on the mainboard. Make sure that the locking clip snaps into place. Then secure the graphics card with a screw to the case.
7. **The Hard Drive**
   - Insert the hard drive into the slot provided in the case and position it so that a screw can be attached on each side for fixation. Then connect the hard drive to the mainboard and the power supply.
8. **The DVD Drive**
   - Insert the DVD drive into the case from the front. Fix it on both sides with the corresponding screws. Connect the DVD drive to the power supply and mainboard.
9. **Startup**
   - Check if all cables are connected. Now close the case. Connect the mouse, keyboard, and monitor to the computer and check its function.

In theory, you could use a word processing program to write a **source code**. However, this would not be practical and an integrated development environment **IDE** is a better tool. An example of such an environment is Eclipse. It is open source and may be used **free of charge**. By using Eclipse you can write code in many languages such as **Java**, C++ or PHP. An IDE contains several features and **modules** that make it easier to create software applications. The source code editor automatically colours **key words** to make it easier to read the code. The editor also checks for the correct **syntax** of the code. It can also detect and underline commonly made **mistakes**. Once the code has been written, it is transformed into something a computer **processor** can understand. This transformation process is called **compilation**. The compiler is part of the IDE. It goes through every **line** of code, and transforms and optimizes it. The IDE also helps with a process called **debugging**. After the source code has been compiled, the IDE starts the new **application** in debug mode. While it is running in this mode, the programmer can tell the IDE to pause the **execution** of the program. This allows him or her to look at what is currently stored in the **memory** area the program is using. This makes it easier to find and **fix** errors, hence the term 'debug'.

I would like to point out that we see a need for improvement in the comment style of your department at the headquarters. Please take note of the following suggestions.

1. Comments should be written in English.
2. A comment explaining the function of the method should be placed before each method.
3. This summary should provide insight into what the code does. The summary should also include a description of the parameters that the method takes.
4. At the end of the comment, include the project name, module name, author, the last modification date of the method, and the current version number.

##### FULL BACKUP
- Capacity / Storage space: needs a lot of storage space 
- Time to save: needs a lot of time  
- Time to restoration: is the fastest

##### INCREMENTAL BACKUP  
- Capacity / Storage space: needs less storage space than for any of the other methods 
- Time to save: much quicker than full backup  
- Time to restoration: needs more time than full backup  


##### DIFFERENTIAL BACKUP 
- Capacity / Storage space: higher than for incremental backups, lower than for full backups 
- Time to save: quicker than for the full backup, slower than from incremental backup 
- Time to restoration: slower than from a full backup, quicker than from incremental backup  


##### MIRROR BACKUP 
- Capacity / Storage space: needs the greatest storage space 
- Time to save: fastest backup method  
- Time to restoration: quickest restoration time
